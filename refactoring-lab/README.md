# Lab 6: Refactoring

The aim of this lab is to get some hands-on experience with refactoring.

Refactoring is the process of changing the internal structure of our code to
make it more comprehensible without changing its external behavior. We do this
because we're not the sole consumers of the code we write: we owe it to our
colleagues (our teammates in this case) and our future selves to make our code
easy to change and understand!

## A simple transcript printing program

For this lab, we're going to be dealing with a simple transcript printing
program. The Java file containing all the classes can be found
[here](RefactoringLab.java). It should run using your standard fare Java IDEs
or if you compile and run the file.

The `generateTranscriptForWidth` is responsible for printing transcripts that
look like this:

```
                    John Chan
                     21039408
                      2017F

COMP3111 Software Engineering 4.00 4
COMP3311 Database Management Systems 3.30 3

Semester GPA: 3.70
```

Then again, we might have specific column limits for our printing, so we can
specify these in our program as well. For example, assuming a column limit 20:

```
     John Chan
      21039408
       2017F

COMP3111
    Software Engineering
    4.00 4
COMP3311
    Database Management Systems
    3.30 3

Semester GPA: 3.70
```

Notice that the lines now "wrap" because the class names don't fit on a single
line with their codes.

Of course, before we print the transcripts, we might want to perform a
"dry run" to figure out how large our transcript will turn out. To enable this,
we also implement a `transcriptHeightForWidth` method that determines the
number of lines for a transcript.

## Your task

We're going to try poke and prod at the transcript program, see where the
design falters, and make **incremental** changes to make the program better.
Some patterns can be found at
Martin Fowler's [excellent refactoring page](https://refactoring.com/catalog/),
but I would suggest first trying to identify *why* the code isn't so good and
suggesting simple ways to fix these problems. For example, pulling out
literals as member variables or blocks of code as methods can be excellent
ways to improve your code.

1.	Update the code that center-aligns the text to use "-" instead of spaces
	*	Was anything lacking in the code? Did you find yourself repeating
		yourself? Was the code easy to maintain? (These problems are often
		referred to as "code smells").
	*	Propose and implement a fix to the problem. Why is it better?
2.	Update the code such that indentations only use 2 spaces, instead of 4.
	*	Did you remember to also update the `transcriptHeightForWidth` method?
	*	What code smells did you encounter here?
	*	Propose and implement a fix to the problem. Why is it better?
3.	As one might expect, the `transcriptHeightForWidth` and
	`generateTranscriptForWidth` classes are structurally similar - after all,
	they're describing the same transcript structure.
	*	Propose and implement some changes that consolidate or improve code
		reuse between the two methods. What are some advantages and
		disadvantages to your approach?
	* 	Bonus: are there any design patterns that *make sense* with respect to
		consolidating these two methods?
